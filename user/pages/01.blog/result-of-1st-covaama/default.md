Dear Community

Last week, COVA has organized an event called #COVAAMA. We asked our community members to ask our questions, in return we will pick the five best questions to answer and reward 1000 COVA tokens. After discussions, we have selected five winners. Without further ado, let’s find out what they have asked about COVA.

*Other than medical, which fields could COVA’s privacy-preserving protocol be applied to?*

Literally everything.

Data is quickly becoming the most important asset in the world, yet currently, there is no infrastructure to control how it is used. COVA provides a unique solution to this dilemma and allows data owners to take advantage of the commodification of data. We want our solutions to be universal to any kind of data, no matter it’s medical, finance, or location. As long as it’s data, COVA will be able to protect it.

There are two reasons explaining why we started with the medical and finance industry. First, COVA is lucky to establish cooperations with some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in China. Secondly, we believe that medical data market has huge commercial potential. Medical data are extremely valuable to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, etc., yet over 90% of data remains locked up in data silos due to concerns about privacy. We believe COVA’s solution will be able to solve this problem, releasing enormous value to society.

*Is COVA mineable? Does it operate on its own chain? Is this computation CPU based or GPU based? Does the systems capabilities play a role in rewards earned?*

Mining paradigm on COVA network is through the TEE network. Anyone can join the network by offering computing power (compute nodes). Compute nodes are similar to mining machines, in the sense that they get rewarded for the computation they perform.

One thing to add is that joining the compute node pool (i.e. mining pool in a normal crypto paradigm) is fully permissionless and hence decentralized. Anyone who will be willing to perform a remote attestation process to verify that their machine has the untampered COVA software can join and mine COVA by performing the computation.

Regarding the chain, we have two chains at the moment: 1. one on ETH network. This one is just for a secure transaction and smart contracts 2. CovaChain. This is where we store metadata and encrypted secret bits (which are put together by routing nodes to generate decryption keys). ETH network is not suitable for this as storing larger data on ETH is still cost prohibitive. In addition, abstract our collection of TEE nodes are part of this CovaChain as it provides secure computation infrastructure.

Currently, the computation is CPU based, but as we are aware that Nvidia and AMD are both actively working on bringing Intel SGX like paradigms to GPUS. Once those are done, I don’t see any reason to not be able to switch to GPUs.

Systems capability does play a role in rewards earned. We have some randomized benchmarking algorithm that would figure out the system’s reward. That said, we have not finished implementing that and will have to wait till next version of the testnet to full have that fair reward system.

*How do you intend to displace existing internet protocols and what is your time frame for that to happen?*

COVA doesn’t displace existing internet protocols. It is a new addition to the internet protocol suite that creates a web of secure and trusted execution. On COVA, data can be controlled with a Smart Policy: a data usage policy written in code that defines and enforces how it can be used.

*When will you open the github?*

Actually, we have opened our GitHub repo. You can check it now at [https://github.com/covalent-hq](https://github.com/covalent-hq)

*What’s next for COVA? Under such bearish market, will the execution of roadmap and whitepaper be affected?*

We have published the roadmap on our website. Technically speaking, we will release the second version of public testnet, COVA-Alpine, which adds more smart policies beyond basic policies and deploys system to COVA protocol partners for various projects.

In 2Q 2019, COVA will starting working on scaling of Covalent TEE network layer, and recruiting compute nodes at scale. Our goal is to collectively surpass computing power of the most powerful supercomputer on the planet, with 4000+ compute nodes; sharding and expand routing nodes for further scaling (i.e. support dataset and compute node provision at scale).

Commercially, we’ll try to get the token listed in more exchanges, establish partnerships in each region, and add more corporate cooperations based on what we have achieved so far.

We have sent out short messages to you guys to collect your wallet address. These rewards will be distributed with our airdrop reward, which will be prior to the exchange listing.

Last but not least, don’t forget to subscribe to COVA’s social media channels:)
