*About COVA*

*Since inception, COVA has been working to establish a new paradigm for data to be used as capital. Data is quickly becoming the most important asset in the world, yet currently there is no infrastructure to control how it is used. COVA provides a unique solution to this dilemma and allows data owners to take advantage of the commodification of data.*

*Powering the COVA network is a substrate of TEE nodes that run COVA software, and provide the horsepower of secured and trusted execution. All data and code that is processed by the COVA network are securely pieced together, hidden and protected inside an enclave. Smart Policies are written in Centrifuge, and provide data owners with a new tool in their arsenal to prevent their precious data from being abused.*
