Dear Community

As COVA has taken top votes in Phase II of HuobiNEXT voting, there will be a lot of news coming out for the next few months, both technically and commercially. Before that, we want to use this opportunity to let you know more about COVA. Therefore, we initiate an event called “COVAAMA”.


We welcome you ask anything you want to know about COVA with #COVAAMA, and we will pick the five best questions to answer and reward 1000 COVA tokens every week. The deadline for the first session will be 2018/12/5 12:00 PM (GMT+8).

## About COVA

Since inception, COVA has been working to establish a new paradigm for data to be used as capital. Data is quickly becoming the most important asset in the world, yet currently there is no infrastructure to control how it is used. COVA provides a unique solution to this dilemma and allows data owners to take advantage of the commodification of data.

Powering the COVA network is a substrate of TEE nodes that run COVA software, and provide the horsepower of secured and trusted execution. All data and code that is processed by the COVA network are securely pieced together, hidden and protected inside an enclave. Smart Policies are written in Centrifuge, and provide data owners with a new tool in their arsenal to prevent their precious data from being abused.
