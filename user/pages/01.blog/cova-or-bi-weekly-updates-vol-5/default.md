COVA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with a top Korean blockchain project, Terra. Through this partnership, COVA expects to expand use cases of data control in e-commerce payments.

Terra is a leading stable cryptocurrency that has secured 15 of some of the largest e-commerce players in Korea and the rest of Asia — including Woowa Brothers, Qoo10, Carousell, Pomelo, and Tiki. Together, these players boast a cumulative 40 million customers and $25 billion in annual transaction volume. Terra’s goal is to use their stable cryptocurrency to bypass high fees charged by existing payment networks like Visa. Terra plans to deploy to its initial e-commerce partners in Korea during 4Q of this year, before widening to cover Southeast Asia and beyond in 2019.
