Also, there’s been an increasing number of community members asking about the public sale. We would like to tell you guys that COVA hasn’t done any public sale yet, and the managing team currently do not have plans to initiate one.

These are all the information we could share with you at the moment. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us using [Telegram Group](https://t.me/covalentofficial).
